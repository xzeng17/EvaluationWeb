# MCB151 course website

I extended the website so that it serves a course website in addition to feebback form

As a teaching assistant for MCB151 at UIUC, I designed a simple evaluation form for students to submit anonymous evaluation form during semester. 

This website collect and post students' forms to my backend server and saved at Mongodb atlas.
